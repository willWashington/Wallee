Wallee is a web platform based on a design by Lance Hilliard called Wally.
    https://github.com/lancehilliard/Wally

Wallee will present a user with a setup screen that allows them to choose various display options.
Wallee will then take the chosen display selection and display a series of user specified websites slowly, swapping between each
    site every time the bottom of the page is reached or after a specific period of time.

Wallee will be designed as "fridge tech".. something you can put on your refrigerator or cabinet door.

Wallee will respond to voice commands and may incorporate Alexa control.
